		PPF graph should be circular low at the beginning. It is the opprotunity cost. It could be the bow or the straight line.
		Bow shape show the increading the opportunity cost.
		Difference between micro and macro economics.
		Should is Normative words or the suggestion.
	
	Videos 6
		Interdependence from the trade
		Assume the straight line for the PPF if not given.
		Absolute advantage : Less requirememt of the resources. 
		Opportunity cost is the cost of producing the single of the itemm from the two.

		table explanation.
		export when u get the value of the commodity value more than your own country

		tariff : tax on imports.
	Video 3
		Externality and market failures.
		Externality are both positive and negative as well.
		
Week 6
	Video 1
		Cost of production
		Isoquant : same amount of quantity produced from diff combination of capital and labours
	Video 2
		Lagrangian fucntions
		At otimality the isoquant = isocost
	Video 3
		Economic profits and accounting profits
	Video 4 
		LRATC and SRATC(short run average total cost) (ns)
		returns to factors(RTS)
	Video 5
		Market structure
		Perfectly competetive market.

Week 7

		MR curve is twice steeper than the demand curve. MR is the Marginal revenue.
		MR=MC at equilibrium.
		Monopolist should operate in the elastic region.
